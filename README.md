# WhatsApp Twilio Bot

#### NOTE: In order to compile and run this project after cloning, you need to create an .env file with below key value pairs:
#### OPEN_AI_KEY = "YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY_VALUE_HERE"
#### TWILIO_AC_SID = "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE"
#### TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE"

There are few tech behind the scene when I posted the YouTube Link. Here‚Äôs a bit descriptive text to give an overall idea what actually have I done so far and how them things goes on:

##### Programming Language: Python3

I have coded a bot in pure Python language which accepts an input from end-user based on the query asked. Now there are few prefixes I have considered to differentiate between the end-user input queries.

##### For an instance, if you want to ask this bot an image response (using openAi Image Creation), you‚Äôre suppose to send him command in the below syntax:

!aimg YOUR QUERY - to lookup for an Image using using OpenAi Image Creation tool (needs an API Key)

!ask YOUR QUERY - Ask a normal chat-flow query to ChatGPT (basically returns text based conversation outputs, includes links to webpages, images, blogs, so on)

##### WhatsApp API : Twilio (an API which provides bi-directional communication flow)

##### Repository Hosted: Github (Dockerfile setup is need to build Docker Image - CI/CD) 

##### Application Deployment: Docker Container using back4app (I used to prefer *Heroku* but since it is now Paid Service, you need to link a credit card/ Payment method in your Account for purchasing Eco dynos)

##### WhatsApp WebApp (Bot) is up & serving: https://whatsappy-sarjeetsandhu.b4a.run/

##### My Another Whatsapp Bot with Additional Features is hosted here: https://whatsapp-sarj33t.b4a.run
