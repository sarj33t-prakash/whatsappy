There are few tech behind the scene when I posted the above YouTube Link. Here‚Äôs a bit descriptive text to give an overall idea what actually have I done so far and how them things go on:

Programming Language: Python3
(I have coded a bot in pure Python language which accepts an input from end-user based on the query asked. Now there are few prefixes I have considered to differentiate the user input queries.

For an instance, if you want to ask this bot an image response, you‚Äôre suppose to send him command in the below syntax:

!img YOUR QUERY

!img - this prefix keyword tells the bot that the incoming query is of type Image and bot process this accordingly. Likewise this, below are the syntaxes currently supported on this bot:

!img - For an Image 

!ud - For fetching an input word‚Äôs meaning (it normally returns funny slangs) from famous Urban Dictionary (needs an API key)

!gif - Famous Giphy (gif provider, needs an API key) 

!weather CITY / REGION Name - 

WhatsApp API : Twilio

Repository Hosted: Github (Dockerfile setup is need to build Docker Image - CI/CD) 

Application Deployment: Docker Container using back4app (I used to prefer Heroku but since it is now Paid Service, you need to link a credit card/ Payment method in your Account for purchasing Eco dynos)

WhatsApp WebApp (Bot) is up & serving: https://whatsapp-sarj33t.b4a.run

Thank y‚Äôall for appreciating the efforts this really helps me to move 1 step further.

I luv to Python ! üôè
